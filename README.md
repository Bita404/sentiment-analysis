This project is using pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to detect emotions in text.

# Requirements

python 3

textblob
transformers
torch 
Datasets
Scikit-learn
Pandas

# usage

scoring emotions in dataset

Load the Dataset:

The GoEmotions dataset from Hugging Face is used for evaluation.
Run the Model:

Use the provided script to classify emotions in the dataset and evaluate the model's performance.

# output 
emotion names and the score of it 
and it will output the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each emotion category.

# Conclusion
This model effectively detects emotions in text, with detailed metrics available for evaluation. Future improvements could include fine-tuning and expanding the dataset.
